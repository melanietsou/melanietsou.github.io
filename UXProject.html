<p>In February 2019, I completed Springboard's UX Design course. As part of the curriculum, I applied the concepts and skills that I learned and completed a capstone project that took me through the entire UX design process from start to finish. The end product was Sebastian, a mobile app designed from scratch to help shoppers better navigate grocery stores.</p> 
</div>
<div class="container">
<h2>The Problem</h2>
<p>Grocery stores are large and can be overwhelming to navigate, with aisles upon aisles of products to choose from and occasional store layout changes. The average grocery store has over 40,000 skus. Some people don't enjoy grocery shopping and would like to get it over with as quickly as possible, while others are looking for ways to save money on their groceries.</p>

<h2>User Research</h2>
</div>
<div class="container">
<p>User research is the first, and arguably the most important, step of the UX design process. Understanding our users' needs, behaviors, thoughts and environments will help ensure we are designing the right product in the right way for the right people.</p>
<p>I created a screener survey to gather primary research on current shopping behaviors and validate the hypothesis that a grocery shopping app would be useful. <a href="https://goo.gl/forms/ZEuKH08Ia1EiN6b22">  <h4>Screener Survey</h4></p>
<div class="container">

</div></a>
</div>
<p></p>
<p>In addition, I further interviewed 3 individuals that completed the screener. </p>
<p>Some of the key findings from the surveys and interviews include:</p>
<p>-Approximately 75% of people use something to keep track of what they need to buy at the grocery store. The main method is “Notes” on a phone, others use apps like Gkeep and Wunderlist.</p>
<p>-Over 50% of people prefer to find items on their own. This is coupled by the fact that majority of people find service to be poor or lacking in most grocery stores, excluding Trader Joe’s. </p>
<p>-Around 90% remember their way around their local grocery stores, which is much higher than predicted. And store layouts do not occur as often as originally hypothesized. However, even if users are familiar with their store layout, an app that shows a map of a grocery would still be helpful in a) an unfamiliar grocery store or b) in a familiar grocery store when users are looking for a product they don’t normally purchase.</p>
<p>-Over 50% of grocery shoppers never use coupons. But they would be open to using digital coupons. Many people do have it as a goal to save money at the grocery store. </p>
<p>-Around 30% of people quite enjoy grocery shopping, while 66% would say they neither like or dislike it. This seems pretty accurate, as I interviewed 3 people and only 1 person said they really enjoy grocery shopping.</p>
<p>Overall, I would say there is definite room for improvement when it comes helping people to have a positive grocery shopping experience.</p>

<h3>Personas</h3>
</div>
<div class="container">
<p>I created personas and empathy maps to help better paint a picture of who my users are. Personas are a representation of a type of user, and there were two main types of users that were uncovered during the research process: Ambitious Amy and Casual Chad.</p>

<h2>Competitive Analysis</h2>
</div>
<div class="container">
<p>I conducted a usability heuristic analysis, focusing on 3 competitor mobile apps. This was useful to understand where their strengths and weaknesses lie and identify usability problems in their interfaces.</p>

<h2>User stories</h2>
<p>User stories will help to create a simple description of a requirement and help keep the project on track during fast iteration cycles and collaborations.</p>

<h2>Wireframing</h2>
<p> sing Balsamiq, a low-fidelity wireframing tool.</p>
</div>
<div class="container">
<h2>Prototype</h2>
<p>Rather than create high-fidelity wireframes to use in the prototype which had a high possibility of  distracting users with the UI, I decided to continue using my low-fidelity wireframes that I created in Balsamiq. I exported each of the wireframes as png files and brought the prototype to life using InVision.</p>
<p>While I was working on the prototype and creating the hotspots where the users would be able to click through the app, I realized that I was missing a couple of key components. One important feature I was missing was “back” buttons, making it impossible for my users to toggle between screens. It was a good thing that this was caught early on as making edits and changes later on would be more time-consuming (and costly for UX projects in the real world).</p>
