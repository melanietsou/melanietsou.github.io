<p>In February 2019, I took part in Springboard's UX Design course.

<h2>The Problem</h2>
Usually, grocery stores are large and hard to navigate, with aisles upon aisles of products to choose from. Grocery stores also often change their store layout. Some people want to save time or are in a rush to get in and get out. In addition, some people are looking to save money by sticking only to their grocery list or to stay healthy and not be tempted to buy junk food.
