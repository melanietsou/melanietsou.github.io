<p>While I was at <a href="https://www.lawsociety.org.uk/" target="_blank">The Law Society</a>, I had the opportunity to run the department's first LinkedIn ad campaign.</p>
<p>I was in charge of the marketing campaign and budget for an annual Human Resources forum known as "People in practice." In addition to the usual marketing mix of emails and direct mail that was done every year, I thought the event could also benefit from a paid social campaign on LinkedIn since most HR professionals use LinkedIn on a daily basis anyways.</p>
<p>The ad was done via a LinkedIn sponsored direct post. For the audience targeting, I focused on HR managers working at law firms in London, Southern and Eastern England since those regions would've been most likely to be able to commute into London for this event.</p>
<p>I did an A/B test with different call-to-action texts using the same image, so the total budget of £300 was split between the two campaigns over a period of two weeks.</p>

<p>The A/B testing showed that version A text had higher CTR, despite having less impressions. It is likely that version A succeeded because the text called out who in particular the event was relevant for early on which encouraged the right people to click.</p> 
<p>Regarding the ROI, it was difficult in this case to pinpoint the exact number of event bookings that came from this particular campaign because 1) the system used for event bookings is not compatible with UTM codes and 2) the web team in charge of our website did not add the LinkedIn Insight Tag. However, after sorting through the event attendees, I found there were 5 attendees that neither received an email or direct mail from me about the event, so it is likely that they booked through the LinkedIn ad. Therefore, the estimated ROI for the campaign is 400% (each individual event booking is £300).</p>
<p>Overall, the event exceeded the original target of 35 attendees - the event had a total of 39 attendees, which was more than the previous two years. </p>
