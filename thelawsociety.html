<p>While I worked at <a href="https://www.lawsociety.org.uk/" target="_blank">The Law Society</a> in London, I had the unique opportunity to run the department's first LinkedIn ad campaign.</p>
<p>I was managing the marketing campaign and budget for an annual Human Resources forum known as "People in practice." In addition to the usual marketing mix of targeted email campaigns and direct mail, I made a business case for trialing a paid social campaign via LinkedIn since most HR professionals are active on that social platform.</p>
<p>The ad was done via a LinkedIn sponsored direct post. For the audience targeting, I selected HR managers working at law firms in London, Southern and Eastern England since those regions made the most sense geographically, with convenient commutes to the event venue.</p>
<p>An A/B test was performed with different call-to-action texts utilizing the same graphic, so the total budget of £300 was split evenly between the two campaigns over two weeks.</p>

<p>The A/B test results showed that version A had a higher CTR, despite receiving fewer impressions. Version A's copy called out the target audience immediately, helping to attract the right professionals who would be interested in attending the conference.</p> 
<p>It was unfortunately a bit difficult in this particular case to pinpoint the exact number of event bookings that could be attributed to my campaign because 1) the online registration system used was not compatible with UTM codes and 2) the web team in charge of The Law Society's website was not able to add the LinkedIn Insight Tag. However, after a thorough analysis of the event attendees, I confirmed there were five attendees that neither received an email or direct mail from me about the event, who likely learned about and registered for the event through the LinkedIn ad. Therefore, the estimated ROI for the campaigsn was 400% (each individual event booking was £300).</p>
<p>Overall, the event exceeded the original target of 35 attendees — the event had a total of 39 attendees, which was more than the previous two years. And while the campaign is not particularly revolutionary or note-worthy in terms of scale, I presented my know-how and findings with my team which enabled them to run subsequent LinkedIn campaigns after my return back to the U.S.</p>
