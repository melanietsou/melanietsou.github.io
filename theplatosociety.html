<p>As part of my Springboard Digital Marketing course in 2019, I participated in the <a href="https://get.google.com/onlinechallenge/" target="_blank"> Google Ad Grants Online Marketing Challenge</a>. This gave me the opportunity to create and execute an online Google Ad campaign for a nonprofit with a monthly budget of $10,000.</p>

I was paired with <a href="https://theplatosociety.org/" target="_blank">The Plato Society</a>, an educational non-profit dedicated to providing intellectually-curious adults with the opportunity to continue learning and form a community with like-minded individuals. The Plato Society offers their members who pay an annual fee the chance to participate in 3 semesters worth of stimulating study discussion groups focused on a wide variety of topics. The target market are adults over 50 years old and seniors, including the retired or semi-retired, who reside in Los Angeles and can attend these study discussion groups in person.</p>

The overall goals of the marketing campaign were to:
<ul style="list-style-type:none;">
  <li>-increase awareness and web traffic</li>
  <li>-attract younger members (ie. anyone 50+ that may not be a retiree yet)</li>
  <li>-encourage people to either sign up to become a member or at least sit in on a course to decide if the Plato Society is right for them.</li>
</ul>
</p>

I startedby running 3 main campaigns: 
<dl>
  <dt>Plato Society Branded Campaign</dt>
  <dd>- included Plato Society-related keywords. This ensured that we control the brand message and we owned the real estate when someone searched "Plato Society".</dd>
  <dt>Retired/Elderly/Senior Campaign</dt>
  <dd>- included keywords related to retirees, elderly and seniors.</dd>
  <dt>Related Discussion Clubs Campaign</dt>
  <dd>- included keywords of various clubs such as book club, socrates club or debate club that have a similar target market to the Plato Society.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="container">
	<p>
The campaigns have started to run as of May 5, 2019 and will run over the course of the next month or so. I will report back on the results and/or any needed adjustments to maximize click-through rates.</p>
