<p>As part of my Springboard Digital Marketing course in 2019, I participated in the <a href="https://get.google.com/onlinechallenge/" target="_blank"> Google Ad Grants Online Marketing Challenge</a>. This gave me the opportunity to create and execute an online Google Ad campaign for a nonprofit with a monthly budget of $10,000.</p>

I was paired with <a href="https://theplatosociety.org/" target="_blank">The Plato Society</a>, an educational non-profit dedicated to providing intellectually-curious adults with the opportunity to pursue learning and form a community with like-minded individuals. Plato Society members paid an annual fee to participate in 3 semesters worth of stimulating study discussion groups focused on a wide variety of topics. The ideal target audiences were adults over 50 years old and seniors, including the retired or semi-retired, who resided in Los Angeles and could attend these study discussion groups in person.</p>

The overall goals of the marketing campaign were to:
<ul style="list-style-type:none;">
  <li>-increase awareness and web traffic</li>
  <li>-attract younger members (ie. anyone 50+ that may not be retired yet)</li>
  <li>-encourage people to either sign up to become a member or sit in on a course to decide if the Plato Society was right for them.</li>
</ul>

I started off by running 3 main ad groups in Google: 
<dl>
  <dt>The Plato Society Branded Campaign</dt>
  <dd>- included Plato Society-related keywords. This ensured that we control the brand message and we owned the real estate when someone searched "Plato Society".</dd>
  <dt>Retired/Elderly/Senior Campaign</dt>
  <dd>- included keywords related to retirees, elderly and seniors.</dd>
  <dt>Related Discussion Clubs Campaign</dt>
  <dd>- included keywords of various clubs such as book club, socrates club or debate club that had a similar target market to the Plato Society.</dd>
</dl>

Please note this page is still in progess and will be updated with full campaign results by the mid-December 2021.</p>
