<p>In October of 2021, I launched one of REBNY's most exciting and revolutionary developments to NYC's real estate industry â€” Citysnap. Citysnap will be the first-ever, consumer-facing residential search website and mobile app for REBNY's Residential Listing Service (RLS), launching in Q2 2022. Citysnap is the result of a strategic partnership with Homesnap, one of the leading national providers of technology solutions for the residential real estate industry.</p> 
<p>Along with the <a href="https://www.rebny.com/content/rebny/en/newsroom/press-releases/2021_Press_Releases/The_Real_Estate_Board_of_New_York_Partners_with_Real_Estate_Technology_Leader_Homesnap_to_Launch_Public_Portal_for_New_York_Citys_Residential_Listing_Service.html" target="_blank">press release</a>, I crafted 3 different announcement emails to ensure our entire membership not only knew the nuts and bolts of what Citysnap was, but also what they could expect and how Citysnap would impact them in the coming months. The 3 target audiences were:
<ol type="1" class="text-left">
  <li>Industry leaders on REBNY's governing Residential Board of Directors, who had been involved in the Citysnap development process</li>
  <li>REBNY's residential brokers and agents, who constitute over 60% of our membership</li>
  <li>The remainder of REBNY's membership, including commercial brokers, building owners/managers and professionals in adjacent industries</li>
</div>
<p>While I am unable to share the internal email to REBNY's Residential Board of Directors as it contains sensitive information, I wanted to share the two email announcements to REBNY's general membership body below.</p>

<h2>Announcement to Residential Members</h2>
</div>
<div class="container">
<p>It was mission critical to get the messaging of this particualar email right. After all, Citysnap is a game-changing product that REBNY is specifically creating for our residential members, and it helps solve many of their pain points with other residential listing websites. The goals for this email were to build excitement within the residential industry and to clearly convey all the exclusive benefits the upcoming Citysnap platform would provide to help agents take their business to the next level.</p>

<h2>Announcement to Non-Residential Members</h2>

<p>For this particular announcement, the goal was to explain how exactly REBNY was disrupting the status quo in NYC's real estate industry and the impact of Citysnap on various residential stakeholders including agents, renters and buyers across the five boroughs.</p>
