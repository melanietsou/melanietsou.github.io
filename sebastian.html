<div class="container">
<p></p>
<p>From February to March 2019, I completed <a href="https://www.springboard.com/" target="_blank">Springboard</a>'s UX Design course. I applied the concepts and skills that I learned to a capstone project that took me through the entire UX design process from start to finish. </p> 
<p>The end product was <strong>Sebastian</strong>, a mobile app designed from scratch to help shoppers better navigate grocery stores.</p>

<h2>The Problem</h2>
<p>Grocery stores are:</p>
<div class="row ">
      <div class="col-sm-6 col-md-3">
        <div class="service-item">
          <i class="ion-compass"></i>
          <h4>Massive</h4>
          <p>Most grocery stores come in at approximately 45,000 square feet - that's not too far off from the size of the White House. </p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="col-sm-6 col-md-3">
        <div class="service-item">
          <i class="ion-compass"></i>
          <h4>Overwhelming</h4>
          <p>The average grocery store has over 40,000 skus and are strategically designed to make shoppers spend more than they intended. </p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="col-sm-6 col-md-3">
        <div class="service-item">
          <i class="ion-compass"></i>
          <h4>Time-Consuming</h4>
          <p>Americans usually spend 43 minutes per trip - excluding travel time. At 1.5 average trips per week, that's 2.5 days at the grocery store every year! </p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="col-sm-6 col-md-3">
        <div class="service-item">
          <i class="ion-compass"></i>
          <h4>Unenjoyable</h4>
          <p>From poor customer service to congested aisles and long check-out lines, it's no wonder people are turning to online grocery shopping.</p>
        </div>

<h2>User Research</h2>
</div>
<div class="container">
<p>User research is the first, and arguably the most important, step of the UX design process. Understanding our users' needs, behaviors, thoughts and environments will help ensure we are designing the right product in the right way for the right people.</p>
<p>What I really wanted to figure out was how Americans currently do their grocery shopping and what (if anything) they would like to improve about their overall experience. So I created a <a href="https://goo.gl/forms/ZEuKH08Ia1EiN6b22" target="_blank">screener survey</a> to gather primary research on shopping behaviors to validate the hypothesis that a dedicated grocery list app would be useful.
<a href="https://goo.gl/forms/ZEuKH08Ia1EiN6b22" target="_blank"> 
<div class="container">
<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/uxproject/Screener.png" alt="Img" >
</div></a>
</div>
<p></p>
<p>In addition, I further interviewed 3 individuals that completed the screener to dig a bit deeper into what pain points a grocery shopping app could help alleviate. </p>
<p>Some of the key findings from the surveys and 30-minute interviews include:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type:circle;">
  <li>Approximately <b>75%</b> of people use something to keep track of what they need to buy at the grocery store. The main method is “Notes” on a phone, others use apps like Gkeep and Wunderlist.</li>
  <li>Over <b>50%</b> of people prefer to find items on their own. This is coupled by the fact that majority of people find service to be poor or lacking in most grocery stores, excluding Trader Joe’s.</li>
  <li>Around <b>90%</b> remember their way around their local grocery stores, which is much higher than predicted. And store layout changes do not occur as often as I assumed. However, even if users are familiar with their store layout, an app that shows a map of a grocery store would still be helpful in a) an unfamiliar grocery store or b) a familiar grocery store when users are looking for a product they don’t normally purchase.</li>
  <li>Over <b>50%</b> of grocery shoppers never use coupons. But they would be open to using digital coupons. Many people have made saving money at the grocery store a goal for themselves.</li>
  <li>Around <b>30%</b> of people enjoy grocery shopping, while 66% would say they neither like or dislike it. This seems pretty accurate, as I interviewed 3 people and only 1 person said they really enjoyed grocery shopping.</li>
</ul>
<p>To view the full summary of results and insights collected from the screeners and interviews, please <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zr4v5SY3r25Xok2sdDGUEIEbR_HeRfrwFl29uQmAkj8/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">click here</a>. </p>
<p>Overall, I would say there is definite room for improvement when it comes to helping people have a more positive and seamless grocery shopping experience.</p>

<h3>Personas</h3>
</div>
<div class="container">
<p>I created personas and empathy maps to help better paint a picture of who my users are. Personas are a representation of a type of user, and there were two main types of users that were uncovered during the research process: Ambitious Amy and Casual Chad.</p>

<h2>Competitive Analysis</h2>
</div>
<div class="container">
<p>I conducted a usability <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sA1lK3wlSCVXAEbMMVLu1H1_1tQGlVhsK2QeO6OIIns/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">heuristic analysis</a>, focusing on 3 competitor grocery list apps. This was useful to understand where their strengths and weaknesses lie and identify usability problems in their interfaces.</p>

<h2>User stories</h2>

<div class="container">
<p>Keeping in mind the needs of Ambitious Amy and Casual Chat, I wrote out <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lfLOT8npQqs24y8Pi3zKSYnGDMMvFQiOXD3dzhvYpo4/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">user stories</a> (which are sentences to describe a simple description of a requirement) to help design the MVP while eliminating feature creep.</p>

    <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/uxproject/user-stories.png" alt="Img">  </p></a>
<h2>Sitemap</h2>
<div class="container">
<p>The next step was to organize how the app's content and functionality would be structured with a sitemap.</p>
<div class="container">
<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/uxproject/Site-map.png" alt="Img">
</div>
<div class="container">
<h2>User Flows</h2>
<p>Before designing the app, it was helpful to create <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/15UcKZ-yrgzfdHn_3KLrswbIhcICX6ZqE/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">user flows</a>, which showed the step-by-step elements required to allow a user to perform a particular task. Below are two example user flows. </p>

<div class="section-title text-center">
  </div>
<h2>Wireframing</h2>
<p> A wireframe is a visual representation of a user interface that gives a sense of how the elements will be placed together on the page. As the first step of the design process, creating the wireframes was a lot more time-consuming and harder than I originally thought. I preferred using <a href="https://balsamiq.com/" target="_blank">Balsamiq</a> over sketching by hand to create the low-fidelity <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1N5AXULie1wj59o5Wh-68Rp661ggRS66lvnFgimV2tIg/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank"> wireframes</a>, as it allowed me to quickly move around different components of each screen quickly and easily. </p>
<p>
It was easiest for me to tackle creating the wireframes based on how users would complete different tasks. The tasks that I focused on creating screens for were:</p>
<div class="container">
<ul>
  <li>Signing up and logging in</li>
  <li>Searching for coupons</li>
  <li>Using a store map and locating a particular item in that store</li>
  <li>Creating a new grocery list and adding an item to the list</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="container">
<div class="section-title text-center">
<div class="section-title text-center">
    <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1N5AXULie1wj59o5Wh-68Rp661ggRS66lvnFgimV2tIg/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank"> 
    <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/uxproject/wireframes.png" alt="Img">  </p></a>
<p>I also decided to sketch out the core features of the “Spending” menu as this was a key differentiating feature that Ambitious Amy would find useful. This included the My Receipts, My Budgets and My Trends screens. 
</p>
<p>A couple of things that I had to consider when making the wireframes included:</p>
<ol type="1">
  <li>What constituted needing a full dedicated screen and what could I get away with using a modal window. For example, the modal window worked well for adding new items to the grocery list.</li>
  <li>Whenever a screen was too empty, I considered combining that screen with another one to streamline the process for the users. On the other hand, when a screen was looking too busy, I had to think about if there was anything that I could cut that was superfluous.</li>
</div>
<div class="container">
<h2>Prototype</h2>
<p>After all the wireframes were created, the next step was to create a working and clickable <a href="https://invis.io/6HQS18XAKTM" target="_blank">prototype</a>. </p>
<p>Rather than create high-fidelity wireframes to use in the prototype which had a high possibility of distracting users with the UI, I decided to continue using my low-fidelity wireframes that I created in Balsamiq. I exported each of the wireframes as png files and brought the prototype to life using <a href="https://www.invisionapp.com/" target="_blank">InVision</a>.</p>
<div class="section-title text-center">
    <a href="https://invis.io/6HQS18XAKTM" target="_blank"> <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/uxproject/prototype.png" alt="Img"> </p></a>
<p>While I was working on the prototype and creating the hotspots where the users would be able to click through the app, I realized that I was missing a couple of key components. One important feature I was missing was “back” buttons, making it impossible for my users to toggle between screens. It was a good thing that this was caught early on as making edits and changes later on would be more time-consuming (and costly for UX projects in the real world).</p>

<h2>Research Evaluation</h2>

<p>After the prototype was completed, I put it to the test with four participants. I had them complete a sample set of tasks and recorded any feedback or difficulties they encountered.</p>
