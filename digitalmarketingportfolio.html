<h1>Digital Marketing Portfolio</h1>
<div class="container">
<p></p>
<p>
<p>From April to May 2019, I completed <a href="https://www.springboard.com/" target="_blank">Springboard</a>'s Digital Marketing course. Over the two months, I completed a series of assignments and a capstone project covering various aspects of digital marketing, from paid search and paid social to content and email marketing. I also completed two certifications as part of the curriculum: Google Analytics for Beginners and Google Ads.

<h2>Buyer Persona</h2>
</div>
I ran a Facebook ad campaign to market one of Springboard’s free resources, an ebook titled <a href="https://www.springboard.com/static/ebook/UX-Guide-Springboard-UX-Career-Guide.pdf" target="_blank">“A Beginner’s Guide To Careers in UX Design”</a>.

<h2>Value Proposition</h2>

<p>I developed a value proposition statement which clearly articulated the value that the ebook delivers to target market. To view the value proposition, please <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MgOwei93XWs21fEFhl2dr5e-il6_BAd158tvnOmfq2w/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">click here</a>.

<h2>Landing Page</h2>

<p>I made a landing page using <a href="https://unbounce.com/" target="_blank">Unbounce</a> where all traffic would go to for future marketing campaigns to drive views and ebook downloads.</p>

<h2>Conversion Rate Optimization</h2>
</div>
<div class="container">
<h2>Google Ads Campaign</h2>
</div>
<div class="container">
<h2>Facebook Ads Campaign</h2>
</div>
I ran a Facebook ad campaign and there were two main target markets that I identified for this campaign:
<ul style="list-style-type:none;">
  <li><b>Employees in Related Industries</b> who are looking to transition into the UX industry
</li>
  <li><b>Students in College/Grad School</b> in cities with top Human-Computer Interaction Programs who are starting to look for their first job.
<div class="container">
<h2>Email Marketing Campaign</h2>
</div>
<p>I created a drip email campaign and the goal of campaign was to convert customers to become a student of Springboard’s UX Design course.
<h3>Email 1</h3>
<a href="https://mailchi.mp/1bd679eddfc4/your-free-ux-design-careers-ebook-has-arrived" target="_blank">Your free UX Design Careers ebook has arrived</a>
<p>The purpose of the email is to get people to view the UX Design Careers ebook, so that they have a free resource from Springboard and are more inclined to read further emails.
<h3>Email 2</h3>
<a href="https://mailchi.mp/047435138a2f/your-free-ux-design-careers-ebook-has-arrived-128629" target="_blank">What a student loved (and hated) about our UX Design Course</a>
<p>The purpose of the email is to convince readers to view the blog post so that they find out more about the UX Design course and are willing to sign up in the final email. 
<h3>Email 3</h3>
<a href="https://mailchi.mp/2b8933fa1b51/your-free-ux-design-careers-ebook-has-arrived-128649" target="_blank">Final chance to join the May Cohort for our UX Design Course - just a few spots remaining!</a>
<p>The purpose of the email is to convert people to sign up and become a UX Design course student.  
<div class="container">
<h2>Capstone Project</h2>
For my capstone project, I am currently participating in the <a href="https://get.google.com/onlinechallenge/" target="_blank"> Google Ad Grants Online Marketing Challenge</a>. This gives me the opportunity to create and execute online Google Ad campaigns for a real nonprofit using a $10,000 USD monthly budget.</p> 
<div class="section-title text-center">
    <a href="https://theplatosociety.org/" target="_blank"> <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/platosocietylogo.png" alt="Img"> </p></a>
	<p></p>
<div class="container">
	<p>
I was paired with <a href="https://theplatosociety.org/" target="_blank">The Plato Society</a>, an educational non-profit dedicated to providing intellectually-curious adults with the opportunity to continue learning and form a community with like-minded individuals. The Plato Society offers their members who pay an annual fee the chance to participate in 3 semesters worth of stimulating study discussion groups focused on a wide variety of topics. The target market are adults over 50 years old and seniors, including the retired or semi-retired, who reside in Los Angeles and can attend these study discussion groups in person.</p>
<div class="container">
	<p>
The overall goals of the marketing campaign are to:
<ul style="list-style-type:none;">
  <li>-increase awareness and web traffic</li>
  <li>-attract younger members (ie. anyone 50+ that may not be a retiree yet)</li>
  <li>-encourage people to either sign up to become a member or at least sit in on a course to decide if the Plato Society is right for them.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<div class="container">
	<p>
I have started running 3 main campaigns: 
<dl>
  <dt>Plato Society Branded Campaign</dt>
  <dd>- includes Plato Society-related keywords. This ensures that we control the brand message and we own the real estate when someone searches "Plato Society".</dd>
  <dt>Retired/Elderly/Senior Campaign</dt>
  <dd>- includes keywords related to retirees, elderly and seniors.</dd>
  <dt>Related Discussion Clubs Campaign</dt>
  <dd>- includes keywords of various clubs such as book club, socrates club or debate club that have a similar target market to the Plato Society.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="container">
	<p>
The campaigns have started to run as of May 5, 2019 and will run over the course of the next month or so. I will report back on the results and/or any needed adjustments to maximize click-through rates.</p>
