<h1>REBNY</h1>
<div class="container">
<p>As the Marketing & Communications Manager of REBNY's Member Services divisions, one of my responsibilities is to create and update collateral that our organization utilizes to attract and retain members.</p>
<p>During the COVID-19 pandemic, it was important for REBNY to keep our membership engaged while socially distanced. However, it was especially challenging to welcome new members as they could no longer attend in-person orientations and networking events to learn more about what our trade association had to offer. To help fill in the gaps and ensure new members would still receive proper onboarding, the Member Handbook was completely revamped with the goal of showcasing the full value of a REBNY membership to new and current members alike.</p>

<h2>The Old Membership Handbook</h2>
</div>
<div class="container">
<p>The problem with the old Member Handbook was that it was a very dense and overwhelming document that served mostly as an information dump. While it described how REBNY was run and the role of various deparments, the feedback we received was that none of that information was particularly helpful or beneficial for members to know.</p>

<h2>The New & Improved Membership Handbook</h2>
<p>After reorganizing, rewriting and redesigning the lengthy document, the end product was a visually appealing and user-friendly Member Benefits Overview. This was a true resource that members could reference on a daily basis to ensure they were maximizing their full suite of REBNY benefits, with clear call-to-actions on how they could access different departments for certain services.</p>
