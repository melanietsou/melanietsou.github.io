<p>After thoroughly editing through the document to cut out extraneous information, the handbook turned into a Member Benefits Overview that more clearly definied the value of REBNY membership, a true resource that members could reference to ensure they were maximzing their benefits, with clear call-to-actions on how they could access different departments for certain services.</p>
