<p>I’ve always enjoyed traveling - even the not-so-glamorous research required at the very beginning stages of planning a trip. I’m pretty meticulous when it comes to scouring the internet for all the best places of interest, food and photo spots that each destination has to offer, often creating my own day-by-day itineraries and an attractions-filled Google Map per city. So while I enjoyed casually sharing my travels on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/melaniedreaming/" target="_blank"> Instagram</a>, I began to feel that I could offer something more of value than just pretty pictures. Thus, the idea for my travel blog,  <a href="https://melaniedreaming.com/?utm_source=GitHub" target="_blank"> Melaniedreaming</a>, was born.</p>

Using Wordpress and a responsive theme that I downloaded, Melaniedreaming is my little corner of the Internet where I can share my past, current and future adventures, as well as post trip itineraries, city guides and any useful travel tips I’ve picked up.</p>

Creating this blog has given me a bit of insight into on-page SEO. The Yoast SEO plug-in helps ensure that all my pages have meta descriptions, my long-form content is keyword-focused and that I include internal and external links when relevant. To speed up the site speed, I’ve used the reSmush.it Image Optimizer plug-in to compress the size of the many images that my blog hosts.</p>

Additionally, I use Google Analytics to track where traffic is coming from, whether is be from organic searches or from my Instagram profile. To date, I’ve received nearly 2,000 page views from people based in over 40 countries. My most popular blog post by far is  <a href="https://melaniedreaming.com/what-to-do-in-copenhagen-on-a-monday/?utm_source=GitHub" target="_blank"> “What to do in Copenhagen on a Monday” </a> - it includes a nifty infographic I created so do check it out if you’re ever heading to Denmark’s capital!
