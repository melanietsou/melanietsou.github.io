During my time at the <a href="https://www.aiidglobal.org/" target="_blank"> American Institute of Implant Dentistry</a> (AIID), I created some direct mail pieces using InDesign. I’d already had experience with the software before as the Editor-in-Chief of a literary and art magazine in college, so I felt comfortable creating brochures and catalogs to help market AIID’s events.

The two pieces that I’ve chosen to highlight are 1) a brochure advertising a symposium in the Bahamas and 2) the 2014 course catalog which was circulated to over 3,000 prospective clients.
