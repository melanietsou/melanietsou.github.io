	As part of the curriculum for my <a href="https://www.springboard.com/" target="_blank">Springboard</a> Digital Marketing course, I ran a Facebook ad campaign to market one of Springboard’s free resources, an ebook titled <a href="https://www.springboard.com/static/ebook/UX-Guide-Springboard-UX-Career-Guide.pdf" target="_blank">“A Beginner’s Guide To Careers in UX Design”</a>.

There were two main target markets that I identified for this campaign:
<ul style="list-style-type:none;">
  <li><b>Employees in Related Industries</b> who are looking to transition into the UX industry
</li>
  <li><b>Students in College/Grad School</b> in cities with top Human-Computer Interaction Programs who are starting to look for their first job.
</li>
</ul>
</p>

Below are the exact audience demographics entered into Facebook:

<p>An A/B test was run to compare which of the two audiences would have a higher click-through rate and engagement with the same ad. </p>

<p>The ultimate goal of the campaign was to drive views and ebook downloads on the below landing page, created using <a href="https://unbounce.com/" target="_blank">Unbounce</a>.</p>

<p>The CPC campaign ran for 5 days and had a total budget of $100. It was a little disappointing to see that the campaign had a relatively low CTR of 0.55% with a total of 62 unique clicks out of 11,255 impressions. However, it was encouraging to see that the CPC was $1.54, which is below the average CPC of $1.86 across all industries.</p> 
<p>Using the Facebook Pixel, I tracked that 5 people actually clicked on the green "Get Your Ebook" button on the landing page, which is about a 8% conversion rate among the 62 total people who ended up clicking on the Facebook ad.</p>
<p>Regarding the A/B test, both audiences had almost the same number of clicks, although employees had both a higher CTR and a higher CPC due to 1000 fewer impressions and 2 fewer clicks. Students had higher engagement with the ad (7 reactions and 2 post saves), likely because they are more active on social media to begin with. </p>
<p>If I had the chance to run the campaign again, I would further narrow down the target audience to improve the CTR (such as changing the age range for employees from 18-35 to 22-35 since most employees are 22+) and also tailor specific ads to each of the two audiences.</p>
