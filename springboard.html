	As part of the curriculum for my <a href="https://www.springboard.com/" target="_blank">Springboard</a> Digital Marketing course, I ran a Facebook ad campaign to market one of Springboard’s free resources, an ebook titled <a href="https://www.springboard.com/static/ebook/UX-Guide-Springboard-UX-Career-Guide.pdf" target="_blank">“A Beginner’s Guide To Careers in UX Design”</a>.

There were two main target markets for this campaign:
<ul style="list-style-type:none;">
  <li><b>Employees in Related Industries</b> who are looking to transition into the UX industry
</li>
  <li><b>Students in College/Grad School</b> in cities with top Human-Computer Interaction Programs who are starting to look for their first job.
</li>
</ul>
</p>

Below are the exact audience demographics used:

An A/B test was run to compare which of the above audiences would have a click-through rate to the same ad, shown below:  </p>
The goal of the campaign was to drive to download the ebook on the below landing page:  </p>

	The CPC campaign ran for 5 days and had a total budget of $100. 
	Installing the Facebook Pixel, I was able to see that 5 people actually clicked on the "Get Your Ebook" button

If I had the chance to run the campaign again, I would further narrow down the target audience to improve the CTR and also tailor specific ads to each of the two ad groups.
