	As part of the curriculum for my <a href="https://www.springboard.com/" target="_blank">Springboard</a> Digital Marketing course, I ran a Facebook ad campaign to market one of Springboard’s free resources, an ebook titled <a href="https://www.springboard.com/static/ebook/UX-Guide-Springboard-UX-Career-Guide.pdf" target="_blank">“A Beginner’s Guide To Careers in UX Design”</a>.

There were two main target markets that I identified for this campaign:
<ul style="list-style-type:none;">
  <li><b>Employees in Related Industries</b> who are looking to transition into the UX industry
</li>
  <li><b>Students in College/Grad School</b> in cities with top Human-Computer Interaction Programs who are starting to look for their first job.
</li>
</ul>
</p>

Below are the exact audience demographics entered into Facebook:

<p>An A/B test was run to compare which of the two audiences would have a higher click-through rate and engagement with the same ad. </p>

<p>The goal of the campaign was to drive ebook downloads on the below landing page, created using <a href="https://unbounce.com/" target="_blank">Unbounce</a>.</p>

<p>The CPC campaign ran for 5 days and had a total budget of $100. The campaign had a relatively low click-through rate of 0.55% with a total of 62 unique clicks out of 11,255 impressions. The CPC was $1.54, which is below the average CTR across all industries of $1.86.</p> 
<p>Using the Facebook Pixel, I was able to see that 5 people actually clicked on the green "Get Your Ebook" button, which is about a 8% conversion rate.</p>

<p>Between the two audiences, The groups had similar clicks number of clicks, although employees had a higher click-through rate. Students were more likely to click probably as they are more active with social media and more likely to be looking for introductory info to UX as they are graduating from college.  </p>

<p>If I had the chance to run the campaign again, I would further narrow down the target audience to improve the CTR and also tailor specific ads to each of the two ad groups. </p>
